## Staging Changes

When using git, there are various stages your files can be in: untracked, modified, staged and committed.

**Untracked:** New files that have been added to your project directory.

**Modified:** Files that have been edited since your last commit.

**Staged:** Files that have been marked as ready to be included in the next commit.

**Committed:** Changes have been synced with your local git repository.

**Pushed:** Changes are now synced with the remote repository and all collaborators.
